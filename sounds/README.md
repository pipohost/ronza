## Chat Sound Effects

This directory contains the sound effect files used in the Ronza Chat application.

You can replace these MP3 files with your own custom sounds. Just ensure the filenames remain the same:

- `message-sent.mp3`: Played when the current user sends a message.
- `message-received.mp3`: Played when a new message from another user arrives.
- `user-join.mp3`: Played when a new user enters the room.
- `user-leave.mp3`: Played when a user leaves the room.
- `mention.mp3`: A distinct sound played when the current user's name is @mentioned.

The audio files should be in a web-compatible format like MP3, OGG, or WAV. MP3 is recommended for the best browser compatibility.
